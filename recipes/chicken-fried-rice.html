    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
      Fried rice is a dish of cooked rice that has been stir-fried in a wok or a
      frying pan and is usually mixed with other ingredients such as eggs,
      vegetables, seafood, or meat. It is often eaten by itself or as an
      accompaniment to another dish. Fried rice is a popular component of East
      Asian, Southeast Asian and certain South Asian cuisines, as well as a
      staple national dish of Indonesia. As a homemade dish, fried rice is
      typically made with ingredients left over from other dishes, leading to
      countless variations. Fried rice first developed during the Sui Dynasty in
      China.
